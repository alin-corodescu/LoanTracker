# High level guidelines

-> This repo contains the code for a personal project that I am building as a finance tracker. Being a personal project, it is mostly a playground for me to experiment with different ideas.

-> The overarching idea of how the logic is modelled is inspired from event sourcing patterns, where the state of the system is derived from a series of events. 

-> I am using markdown files as brain dumps for architectural decisions and user journeys, but they are not very polished.

-> You as copilot should not create/ modify more markdown files unless specifically prompted. If anything needs to be documented, do so in the code.
